Hi, I'm Gallium! Creator of [Paradox](https://github.com/benzarr410/Paradox), [BD Nametags](https://github.com/benzarr410/beautifuldiscord-nametags), and [shitty bash scripts](https://github.com/benzarr410/command-line-randomness).

You get the deal by now, [issues](https://github.com/benzarr410/Selfbot/issues), [PRs](https://github.com/benzarr410/Selfbot/pulls)

# But how install?

Oh, you wanna install this?

Well, make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/benzarr410/Selfbot
    cd Selfbot/
    npm i --save discord.js hastebin-gen

This will download the bot and install the dependencies that need it to be run. To start the bot, just run the command:

    node bot

in your Selfbot folder.
